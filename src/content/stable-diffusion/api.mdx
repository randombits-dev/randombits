## Reasons to use the API

**1. Automated Processes**. You can create a script that generates images while you do other things. The script can randomize parameters to achieve different results. Or the script could go through a list of prompts and generates images for each prompt.

**2. Building a client app**. Build and monetize an app that will generate images for other users.

## Getting Started

When you start Automatic1111, make sure to include the `--api` option. For example:

```
stable-diffusion-webui/webui.sh --listen --xformers --api
```

All endpoints are located at: `/sdapi/v1/*`. For example, `http://localhost:7860/sdapi/v1/txt2img`.

The official api spec can be seen by going to `/docs` on your server, but it is very basic.
