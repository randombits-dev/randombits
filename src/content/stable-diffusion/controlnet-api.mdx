## Intro

ControlNet allows users to control the generation process of stable diffusion images with spatial contexts. One of the  most common examples is using a "pose" - a stick figure drawing to control the position of a person in the output. But there are many other use cases.

> You must have the ControlNet extension installed in Automatic1111.

## Encode Input in Base64

Since we need to send an image to our server, we need to encode the image in base64. This example uses javascript:

```js
const buf = fs.readFileSync('my-file.png');
const myBase64EncodedImage = Buffer.from(buf).toString('base64')
```

## API Request

> POST /sdapi/v1/txt2img

To use ControlNet, we use the same `txt2img` endpoint, but we pass in extra params:

```json
{
  "prompt": "Sunset in the mountains, lake in front",
  // other txt2img params
  "alwayson_scripts": {
    "controlnet": {
      "args": [
        {
          "input_image": myBase64EncodedImage,
          "model": "depth_fp16",
          "module": "depth"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The **input_image** param should be encoded base64 string of your input image.

The **module** param is the name of the preprocessor to use.

The **model** param should be set to the name of a ControlNet model you have installed. For example, if your model name is called `depth_fp16.safetensors`, the value should be `depth_fp16`.
