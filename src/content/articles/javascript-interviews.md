## What makes a good frontend developer?

**A full-stack developer.**
Yes, seriously. I find that purely frontend developers lack experience with core programming concepts, and often struggle to work on complex applications. Many frontend developers are self-taught, or have forgotten core programming concepts from college or previous work. By core programming concepts I mean things like data structures, design patterns, understanding of how databases work, etc.

**Someone who has solid understanding of typescript/javascript, the browser, and HTTP concepts**
Don't prioritize finding a candidate that has experience with the framework and libraries you use (i.e. react, tailwind). Prioritize finding a candidate that knows how the basics work. A good developer will be able to pick up any framework and library relatively quick.

## The technical questions

Good interview questions will not quiz the candidate on how much they studied for it.

### Bad question examples

Explain variable hoisting in javascript? This is like asking whether someone can do long division when everyone has a calculator. In modern code, developers aren't concerned with this anymore and might not remember it.

## Some interview topics

Explain some REST authentication concepts? Cookies, Auth token, etc.
Explain the different between Server side rendering, client side rendering, hybrid rendering, static generation
Iframes? How do you communicate between frames? window.postMessage.
What is CORS (Cross origin request). How do you allow cross site requests? (OPTIONS request)
Difference between session storage, local storage, and indexed DB? What are performance differences?
What are service workers?
Explain how websockets work? When are they used?
How does browser caching work? How do ETags work?

What are the differences between interface and type in typescript?
Explain what generics are (in typescript or other language) and why they are useful?
Difference between const and let
Can you push to an array declared as const? Why?
