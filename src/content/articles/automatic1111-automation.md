I've been running an automated process to generate images, while I'm away from my computer.

## Why?

1. I can get the most value out of my Google Cloud GPU Server rental, since whenever the server is running, its generating images non-stop.
2. I can generate prompts automatically, so I don't have to think of prompts and type them everytime.
3. I can test different settings by getting a large sample size of images.

## Getting Started

Make sure you pass the `--api` flag when starting your automatic1111 server.
