This is the full list of locales, as maintained by the *International Components for Unicode*.
For each locale, the grouping pattern, grouping symbol, decimal symbol, and numeric system are shown.
For descriptions of these properties, see the [Number Localization Introduction](/number-localization/).

> Some of these properties are not consistent between javascript runtimes.
For example, the numbering system and grouping pattern may differ between nodejs and chrome.
This list was generated using Node v18.
