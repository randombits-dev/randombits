This is the full list of numbering systems, as maintained by the *International Components for Unicode*.

## Fully supported numbering systems

These are the numbering systems in which the characters are fully supported out-of-the-box.
See the [formatting guide](formatting) for how to use these numbering systems.

## Numbering Systems requiring custom fonts

The following numbering systems are uncommon, and you need special fonts to display the characters.

There is a <a href="https://fonts.google.com/noto/fonts" target="_blank">*Noto*</a> font for each of these numeric systems.

> An example of how uncommon these are: The Gunjala Gondi traditional script was almost forgotten, with very few people still able to read it. Researchers documented the script in 2014, and it became supported in 2018, although most Gond people don't even know of its existence.

## Algorithmic Systems

These number systems are not base-10, but instead are calculated with a formula. The most recognizable example is Roman Numerals.

Here is the full list. These are generally not used in modern applications or browsers.
