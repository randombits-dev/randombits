A *number* consists of the integer part and decimal part, separated by the **decimal symbol**.
The integer part may be separated by the **grouping symbol** (sometimes called the **thousand symbol**), which makes long numbers easier to read.

In the United States, we use a period for the decimal symbol and a comma for the grouping symbol.

## Decimal Symbols

The three different decimal symbols are the **comma**, the **period**, and the **arabic decimal separator**.

## Grouping Symbols

The six different grouping symbols are the **comma**, the **period**, a **space**, a **narrow space**, the **arabic thousands separator**, and the **right quotation mark**.

## Grouping Patterns

The most common pattern for grouping is every 3 digits. But some locales in and around **India** use a unique 2-digit grouping system.

Here is what the number 1 billion looks like with both grouping patterns, and a comma as the grouping symbol.

<GroupingPatterns/>

Notice that the 2-digit grouping still uses 3 digits for the right-most group, but groups by 2 digits for everything else.

## Distinct Formatting Patterns

Here are the different combinations of formatting patterns across all supported locales:

## Minus Signs

There are two different symbols used for minus signs. The **hyphen** is used in most locales, but there is a longer **minus sign** symbol that is used as well.

<NegativeSymbols/>

## Numbering Systems

The numbers 0-9 are called **arabic numerals**, **latin numerals**, or **western numerals**.

> The term **arabic numerals** can be confusing, because although they invented the number system, they no longer use it.

Here is a small sample of common numbering systems, but there are many others:
