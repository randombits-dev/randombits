## About

FontFrame is a Canva app that allows you to add an image background to your text, by uploading an image, or selecting an image from your design. Change the font, adjust the image placement, and more.

## Premium

FontFrame Premium is a paid version of FontFrame that unlocks these additional features:
* Over 15000 new fonts
* 3d projection effects
* Shadow effects
* Special effects

You can purchase Premium within the Canva app. 

<!-- Users can click on the "Purchase Premium" link, which will take them to the checkout page. -->

**Please note that having a subscription to Canva Pro does not give you access to FontFrame Premium.** Since I am an independent developer and do not receive money from Canva to support my app, I am charging a small fee to access premium features.
