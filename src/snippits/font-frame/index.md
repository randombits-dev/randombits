## About

FontFrame is a Canva app that allows you to add an image background to your text, by uploading an image, or selecting an image from your design. Change the font, adjust the image placement, and more.

## Premium

FontFrame Premium is a paid version of FontFrame that unlocks these additional features:
* Over 15000 new fonts
* 3d projection effects
* Shadow effects
* Special effects

You can purchase Premium within the Canva app. 

**Please note that having a subscription to Canva Pro does not give you access to FontFrame Premium.** Since I am an independent developer and do not receive money from Canva to support my app, I am charging a small fee to access premium features.


## FAQ

### I have a Canva Pro subscription, why do I have to pay for FontFrame Premium?
Since I am an independent developer and do not receive money from Canva to support my app, I am charging a small fee to access premium features.

### Why can't I purchase Premium on an Android device?
Google has a strict policy against payment links in apps. You must be running Canva through a browser to make the purchase. Then you can go back to the app. If Canva in the browser keeps redirecting you to the app, you can go to your profile settings in Canva, and disable "Open designs in a new tab".

### Are your fonts royalty-free?
Yes, all fonts can be used for commercial purposes with no restrictions.

### Why is the output blurry?
The app tries to automatically size the text so that it can fit the width of the page. Sometimes, it doesn't work perfectly. The workaround is to output to a page that has a higher resolution and copy to your real design.

Example: Create a new design (or add a new page on your existing design) and make it a custom size with dimensions bigger than your current page. Use the app to output to this new page, then copy the output to your real design. If you are designing for a standard size paper (8.5x11), you can try creating a new page with dimensions of 3000x3000.

### I already paid for FontFrame Premium, why is it asking me to pay again?
If you are using a different device, you may have to click the "Reload app" button to fetch the license on each device.

### Why is the "Use selected image" button disabled?
If you have an image selected in your design, but the "Use selected image" button is disabled, it means that the image cannot be used. Only raster images (think photos) are compatible, while vector images (think simple graphics like icons and clipart) are not. This is a Canva limitation. However, there is a trick to get it to work. Put the image on a blank page in your design and download the image as either a PNG or JPG file. Then select the downloaded file in the app.

### Why can't I access Canva fonts in FontFrame?
Canva does not allow apps to access their fonts.
