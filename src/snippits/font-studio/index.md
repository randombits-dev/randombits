## About

FontStudio is a Canva app that allows you to create text effects using an advanced layering system. You can create layers of outlines, 3D projects, and shadows to stunning designs.

## Premium

FontStudio Premium is a paid version of FontStudio that unlocks these additional features:
* Over 15000 new fonts
* Over 100 new templates
* Ability to upload custom fonts
* Fun special effects

You can purchase Premium within the Canva app. 

**Please note that having a subscription to Canva Pro does not give you access to FontStudio Premium.** Since I am an independent developer and do not receive money from Canva to support my app, I am charging a small fee to access premium features.


## FAQ

### I have a Canva Pro subscription, why do I have to pay for FontStudio Premium?
Since I am an independent developer and do not receive money from Canva to support my app, I am charging a small fee to access premium features.

### I already paid for FontStudio Premium, why is it asking me to pay again?
If you are using a different device, you may have to click the "Reload app" button to fetch the license on each device.

### Why is the "Use selected image" button disabled?
If you have an image selected in your design, but the "Use selected image" button is disabled, it means that the image cannot be used. Only raster images (think photos) are compatible, while vector images (think simple graphics like icons and clipart) are not. This is a Canva limitation. However, there is a trick to get it to work. Put the image on a blank page in your design and download the image as either a PNG or JPG file. Then select the downloaded file in the app.

### Why can't I access Canva fonts in FontStudio?
Canva does not allow apps to access their fonts.
