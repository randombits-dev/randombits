Hi, I'm **Matthew Nienow**, a software engineer from Duluth, Minnesota, USA. 

**Random Bits** is my business name.

## Experience
I've been a full-stack engineer for about 14 years, although I've recently been more front-end focused.

## Education

BS in Computer Engineering @ Michigan Technological University

## Motivations

**Privacy.** I'm a big privacy advocate, and fan of client-side encryption or end-to-end encryption (E2EE). I also believe in limiting stored user data, making sure that any analytical data is completely anonymous, and prioritizing security.

**Offline-first development.** By building web apps to work offline (service workers, server-side push, etc), it also results in an app that feels like a desktop app with near instant loading times.

**Performance and optimization.** I have worked on some very complex applications, and love optimizing code in order to deliver blazing quick and lightweight solutions.

**Eye comfort and readability.** I've had some eye issues from staring at computer screens too much, which I fixed by reducing the contrast and blue light from my monitor. So when styling applications, I am more aware of eye comfort and overall readability of font styles in general.

## Favorite UI Tech Stack

My favorite tech stack is always changing as new technologies come out. But here is my current favorites:

For static site generation (SSG), **Astro** is amazingly simple and flexible. 

For reactive frameworks, I currently am digging both **SolidJS** and **Svelte**.

When you pair Astro with a reactive framework, it gets even better. Astro components are used for static pages like landing pages, help docs, etc. And then your reactive framework is used for your web application or any advanced functionality.

For very large and complex enterprise applications, I still think **Angular** is the best choice.

## Hobbies
Outside of work, I enjoy mountain biking, hiking, reading non-fiction books (learning new stuff), and playing with our dog Basti.
