Hi, I'm **Matthew Nienow**, a software engineer from Duluth, Minnesota, USA. 

**Random Bits** is my business name.

## Experience
I've been a full-stack engineer for about 14 years, although I've recently been more front-end focused. Most of my experience has been in the enterprise space, working on large and complex CRM applications. 

## Strengths
Some of my strengths include:
* Rapid prototyping - I'm a big fan of the "fail fast" mentality, and love to get a prototype out the door as quickly as possible. While other developers are still debating the best tech stack, I've already got a prototype up and running.
* Debugging - Some of the highlights of my career are figuring out complex production issues that seemed completely random. I have often stepped out of my realm of expertise to solve a problem that no one else could, including issues with the database, server, or even network issues.
* Performance and optimization - I love optimizing code by using efficient data structures and caching techniques, to make an application as fast and lightweight as possible.

## Open Source
I'm a big fan of open source, and try to contribute to open source projects as much as time allows. The biggest contributions I've made are related to Standard Notes (a privacy focused and simple note-taking app) where I've worked on plugins and tooling infrastructure to make it easier to write plugins.
I also maintain several of my own open source projects.

## Education

BS in Computer Engineering @ Michigan Technological University

## My recent interests

**Privacy.** I'm a big privacy advocate, and fan of client-side encryption or end-to-end encryption (E2EE). I also believe in limiting stored user data, making sure that any analytical data is completely anonymous, and prioritizing security.

**Offline-first development.** By building web apps to work offline (service workers, server-side push, etc), it also results in an app that feels like a desktop app with near instant loading times.

**Eye comfort and readability.** I've had some eye issues from staring at computer screens too much, which I fixed by reducing the contrast and blue light from my monitor. So when styling applications, I am more aware of eye comfort and overall readability of font styles in general.

## Favorite UI Tech Stack

My favorite tech stack is always changing as new technologies come out. But here is my current favorites:

For static site generation (SSG), or hybrid rendering, **Astro** is amazingly simple and flexible. 

For reactive frameworks, I currently am digging both **SolidJS** and **Svelte**. SolidJS is an optimized reactive framework that is very fast and has a very small bundle size (compared with React). Svelte is extremely fast as well, and has a unique way of writing components that is very easy to understand.

When you pair Astro with a reactive framework, it gets even better. Astro components are used for static pages like landing pages, help docs, etc. And then your reactive framework is used for your web application or any advanced functionality. Astro can also be used to write micro frontends.

For very large and complex enterprise applications, I still think **Angular** is the best choice.

## Hobbies
Outside of work, I enjoy mountain biking, hiking, reading non-fiction books (learning new stuff), and playing with our dog Basti.
