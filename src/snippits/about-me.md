Hi, I'm Matthew Nienow, a full-stack developer from Duluth, Minnesota, USA.


### Experience
I've been a full-stack developer for about 14 years, although I've recently been more front-end focused.

### Interests

I'm a big privacy advocate, and fan of client-side encryption or end-to-end encryption (E2EE). In general, I like limiting stored data, making sure that any analytical data is completely anonymous, and using beyond-the-standard security practices.

Offline-first mindset. By building web apps to work offline (service workers, server-side push, etc), it also results in an app that is blazing fast with near-instant loading times.

I love optimizing applications for blazing fast performance and near instant loading.

### Favorite UI Tech Stack

For static site generation (SSG), **Astro** is amazingly simple and flexible. 

For reactive frameworks, I currently am digging both **SolidJS** and **Svelte**.

Why not react? React and NextJS are great for fast development, because of the huge amount of component libraries and numerous stack overflow answers to common problems. But compared to new lightweight alternatives like SolidJS, it feels heavy and outdated.

### Hobbies
Outside of work, I enjoy mountain biking, hiking, reading non-fiction books (learning new stuff), and playing with our dog Basti.
