## My Process

1. In an initial meeting, we will talk about the business goals or challenges that you want to solve. We will also determine if I am a good fit for the project.
2. We will work together to define requirements of the project, and I will provide a proposal with a timeline and cost estimate.
3. The work will be done in an iterative process, with regular demos and feedback. This allows for changes to be made early and often, and ensures that the final product matches your vision.
4. The final product will be delivered to a staging environment, where it can be thoroughly tested. After any issues are resolved, the product will be deployed to production.
5. After the product is live, I will provide support and maintenance as needed.

Hi, I'm **Matthew**, a software engineer from Duluth, Minnesota, USA. I recently founded *Random Bits Software Engineering*, after working for 14 years designing and building enterprise web applications in the corporate world. I'm passionate about building high-quality, performant, and user-friendly web applications.

## My code philosophy

**Performance and optimization.** I love optimizing code by using efficient data structures and caching techniques, to make an application as fast and lightweight as possible. These techniques also help in reducing network traffic, reducing server load, and lowering costs.

**Privacy.** I'm a big privacy advocate, and fan of client-side encryption or end-to-end encryption (E2EE). I also believe in limiting stored user data, making sure that any analytical data is completely anonymous, and prioritizing security.

**Offline-first development.** By building web apps to work offline (service workers, server-side push, etc), it also results in an app that feels like a desktop app with near instant loading times. Even if the app is never intended to be used offline, it still results in a better user experience.

**Prototype before Design.** I'm a big fan of extreme programming methodology, and the "fail fast" mentality. I love to get a prototype out the door as quickly as possible, to verify the initial vision. While other developers are still debating the best tech stack, I've already got a prototype up and running.

## Open Source
I'm a big fan of open source, and try to contribute to open source projects as much as time allows. The biggest contributions I've made are related to Standard Notes (a privacy focused and simple note-taking app) where I've worked on plugins and tooling infrastructure to make it easier to write plugins.

## Education

BS in Computer Engineering @ Michigan Technological University

## Favorite Tech

My favorite tech stacks are always changing as new technologies come out. But here is my current favorites:

### UI Frameworks

For static site generation (SSG), or hybrid rendering, **Astro** is amazingly simple and flexible. It is like a more generic version of NextJS.

For reactive frameworks, I've used Angular, React, Svelte, and SolidJS for building web applications. My current favorites are **SolidJS** and **Svelte**. SolidJS is an optimized reactive framework that is very fast and has a very small bundle size (compared with React). Svelte is extremely fast as well, and has a unique way of writing components that is very easy to understand.

For very large and complex enterprise applications, I still think **Angular** is the best choice.

### Backends

For backends, I try to use serverless functions and managed databases as much as possible, for their simplicity and scalability. I use **Cloudflare**, **AWS**, or **Google Cloud** depending on the project requirements, expected usage, and budget.

## Hobbies
Outside of work, I enjoy mountain biking, hiking, reading non-fiction books (learning new stuff), and playing with our dog Basti.
