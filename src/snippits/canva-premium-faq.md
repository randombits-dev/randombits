## Premium FAQ

<!-- This is the FAQ is for the Premium version of the Canva apps FontFrame and FontStudio -->

### I have a Canva Pro subscription, why do I have to pay for Premium?
Since I am an independent developer and do not receive money from Canva to support my app, I am charging a small fee to access premium features.

### Is Premium a subscription, or a one-time purchase?
It is a one-time purchase for a lifetime license (valid as long as Canva and the app are operational).

### I just purchased Premium, but the app still says I don't have Premium.

First, make sure you click the "Reload app" button in the app, on the Premium information page. Sometimes, it can take several minutes after purchase until that button correctly loads your license.

If that doesn't work, make sure you are using the same Canva account that you used when the purchase was made. Your Premium license is automatically attached to the account you were using when you clicked the purchase link.

### Why can't I purchase Premium on an Android device?
Google has a strict policy against payment links in apps. You must be running Canva through a browser to make the purchase. Then you can go back to using the app.

By default, when running Canva in the browser on a mobile device, you are redirected the app when opening the design. This could prevent you from making the purchase. To get around this, go to your profile settings in Canva, and disable "Open designs in a new tab".

### I already paid for Premium, why is it asking me to pay again?
If you are using a different device, you may have to click the "Reload app" button to fetch the license on each device.

<!-- Unless the user purchased a team license, the license is attached to a single Canva account, and the user can only use Premium on that account. -->
