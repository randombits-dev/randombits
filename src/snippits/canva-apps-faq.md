## App FAQ

<!-- This is FAQ is for the Canva apps FontFrame and FontStudio -->

### Are your fonts royalty-free?
Yes, all fonts can be used for commercial purposes with no restrictions.

### Why is the output blurry?
The app tries to automatically size the text so that it can fit the width of the page. Sometimes, it doesn't work perfectly. The workaround is to output to a page that has a higher resolution and copy to your real design.

Example: Create a new design (or add a new page on your existing design) and make it a custom size with dimensions bigger than your current page. Use the app to output to this new page, then copy the output to your real design. If you are designing for a standard size paper (8.5x11), you can try creating a new page with dimensions of 3000x3000.

### Why is the "Use selected image" button disabled?
If you have an image selected in your design, but the "Use selected image" button is disabled, it means that the image cannot be used. Only raster images (think photos) are compatible, while vector images (think simple graphics like icons and clipart) are not. This is a Canva limitation. However, there is a trick to get it to work. Put the image on a blank page in your design and download the image as either a PNG or JPG file. Then select the downloaded file in the app.

### Why can't I access Canva fonts in the app?
Canva does not allow apps to access their fonts.
