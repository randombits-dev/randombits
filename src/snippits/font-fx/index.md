## About

FontFX is a Canva app for crafting striking font effects quickly. Layer outlines, shadows, and special stylings to make your text stand out in any design.

## Premium

FontFX Premium is a paid upgrade that unlocks these additional features:
* Access to thousands of additional fonts
* Extra effect layers and presets
* Advanced shadows and projections
* Fun special effects

You can purchase Premium within the Canva app.

**Please note that a Canva Pro subscription does not include access to FontFX Premium.** FontFX is built and maintained independently, and a small fee helps support ongoing development.

## FAQ

### I have a Canva Pro subscription. Why do I have to pay for FontFX Premium?
Since FontFX is an independently developed app and not funded by Canva, Premium features require a small, separate fee.

### I already paid for Premium. Why is it asking me to pay again?
If you are using a different device, click the "Reload app" button inside the app to fetch your license on that device.

### Why can’t I access Canva fonts in FontFX?
Canva does not allow third‑party apps to access their font library.
