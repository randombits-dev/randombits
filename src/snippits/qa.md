### What is your favorite UI Tech Stack?

For static site generation (SSG), **Astro** is amazingly simple and flexible.

For reactive frameworks, I am currently digging both **SolidJS** and **Svelte**.

When you pair Astro with a reactive framework, it gets even better. Astro components are used for static pages like landing pages, help docs, etc. And then your reactive framework is used for your web application or any advanced functionality. 

### What about React?

React and NextJS are great for fast development, because of the huge amount of component libraries and numerous stack overflow answers to common problems. But compared to new lightweight alternatives like SolidJS, it feels heavy and outdated.
