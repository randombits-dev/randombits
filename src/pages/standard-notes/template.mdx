This template repo gives you everything you need to start building a standard notes extension.

## Getting Started

On the github page, https://github.com/nienow/sn-extension-template, there is a `Use this template` button, which will create a new repo based on this template.

## Demo Page

The template includes a separate demo page that allows you to develop and test your extension without it running inside standard notes.
It works by wrapping your editor with a **mock standard notes**, which sends and receives the same events that the real application would.

The demo page and related scripts is built as a separate entry, and therefore is not included in your actual editor
build. It is only included in the demo.html page.

The demo page can also be used to demonstrate your extension on your personal website or blog, like you see below:

## Extension JSON

When users install your extension, they will be using the ext.json file, which contains information about your extension.
You will want to edit this file at `public/ext.json`, changing the urls, identifier, and name.

The `public/local.json` file can be used if you want to install your editor into standard notes while it is running on localhost.
It has a separate name and identifier so that you can install both the production version and dev version in standard notes at the same time.

## Preact Framework

This template uses **Preact** instead of **React**. But because we are also pulling in the
**@preact/compat** package, it is compatible with the React API and can be written the same as React.

If you don't know about Preact, it is smaller and faster than React, and contains basically all the React
functionality, so there is no reason not to use it.

## Github Workflow

There is a github workflow setup in `.github/workflows/node.js.yml`, which will automatically build and deploy your
extension to github pages.

Make sure you have your Workflow Permissions set to "Read and write permissions" (under Settings -> Actions -> General).



```typescript:index.tsx
import React from 'react';
import {createRoot} from "react-dom/client";
import {EditorProvider} from "./providers/EditorProvider";
import ComponentRelay from "@standardnotes/component-relay";

let currentNote;

const componentRelay = new ComponentRelay({
  targetWindow: window,
  options: {
    coallesedSaving: true, // saving uses a debounce value
    coallesedSavingDelay: 400 // 400 ms
  }
});

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
componentRelay.streamContextItem((note) => {
  currentNote = note;
  if (note.isMetadataUpdate) {
    return; // don't care about metadata updates
  }
  const text = note.content?.text || '';
  const isLocked = componentRelay.getItemAppDataValue(note, 'locked');

  root.render(
     <EditorProvider text={text} save={save} isLocked={isLocked}/> // my custom editor component
  );
});

const save = (data: any) => {
  componentRelay.saveItemWithPresave(currentNote, () => {
    currentNote.content.text = JSON.stringify(data);
    currentNote.content.preview_plain = data.text;
  });
};
```
