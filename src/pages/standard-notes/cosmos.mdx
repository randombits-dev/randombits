## How it works

<img src="/images/cosmos-instr.png" width="100%"/>

The **columns** and **rows** controls allows you to change the number of areas in the note.

By default, the title of each area only shows up when the toolbar is open. The **Always Show Title** option enables always showing the title.

The bottom toolbar opens automatically when creating a new note, but will be collapsed when opening that note again. Use the expand/collapse arrow to show/hide the toolbar.

## History

I first built an extension called "Splitter" because I was consistently wanting to separate a note into multiple sections.
Originally, it just worked with the plain text editor, and it was not polished, so I didn't share it publicly.

Later, I had the idea to create some sort of marketplace, where users could install new extensions without having to find the ext.json of each extension.

Finally, I combined the two ideas, and created Cosmos.

## Security

I plan to audit the code of all extensions that are included in the marketplace.
Basically, an extension should never be sending any note data across the network.
It should only communicate back and forth with Standard Notes.

## FAQ

**I built an extension. How can I add it to the Cosmos Marketplace?**
