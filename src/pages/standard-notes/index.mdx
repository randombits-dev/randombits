## Extension Introduction

There are a few different types of Standard Notes extensions:

**Editor**. Loads a 3rd party application in the *edit* area.

**Theme**. Loads a 3rd party stylesheet to change the theme of the entire application.

## Installing extensions


Standard Notes is my favorite note platform. Some reasons why I like it:

1. Its open source
2. Its fast and lightweight
3. Its client side encrypted
4. Writing extensions is easy
5. You can use it for free, minus the premium features
6. You can self-host it
