## Documentation

### Mode

* Grid - Splits the note into equally sized areas. Each area can have its own scrollbar if the content grows too big.
* Sections - Collapses the height of the rows to the largest content in the row. It auto-expands if the content grows.

### Columns

Controls the column count. Decreasing the columns will automatically add rows to preserve the data.

### Rows

Controls the row count. This is how you add and remove areas. Removing rows with content will warn the user.

### Show Title

Whether or not to show a title field above the area.
