# The ultimate guide to number input localization

Although the built-in browser support for localization is getting better, it is still difficult to get right. 
This guide is especially useful if your application allows the user to modify their preferred locale, instead of using the browser locale.

## Inputs with type number

Using `<input type="number"/>` only parses numbers in the browser's locale. 
Also, there are some cases where it doesn't play well with group separators (thousand separators). 

This is fine for many applications, since the user most likely only wants to work in their one locale. 
And most users would not be entering a number with group separators.

However, I've worked on several CRM applications that allowed the user to switch the locale they wanted to work in. After having to implement this ability several times in the frontend, I've come up with an easy and elegant solution.

## Basic Requirements

To allow a user to input numbers in a different format, we need the following:

1. An input of type *text*, since the number can contain symbols that are not allowed in type *number*
2. A method to parse the user input to a javascript number
3. Unless the input will always start out blank, a method to format the initial server side value to the locale formatted value

## Formatting a number

Its easy to format a number in any locale. You can use

```javascript
function formatNumber(value) {
    return Intl.NumberFormat('de-DE').format(value);
}

formatNumber(1234.56); // 1.234,56
```

## Parsing a number

It's not so easy to parse a number in any locale, since there isn't an API for that. We need to figure out the **group** symbol and the **decimal** symbol of the locale. For example, here are the symbols for the following locales:


| Locale  | Example     | Group Symbol  | Decimal Symbol |
|---------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| en-US   | 1,234.56    | , (comma)     | . (period)     |
| de-DE   | 1.234,56    | . (period)    | , (comma)      |
| fr-CA   | 1 234,56    | (space)       | , (comma)      |

In order to determine these symbols, we first format a number from that locale. 
Then we can parse the output to determine the symbols:

```javascript
const parts = new Intl.NumberFormat('de-DE', {style: 'decimal'}).formatToParts(1111.11);
const groupPart = parts.find((d) => d.type === 'group')?.value;
const decimalPart = parts.find((d) => d.type === 'decimal').value;
```

Now we know the symbols for the locale. So now lets parse something:

```javascript
function parseInput(value) {
    // check if negative
    const isNegative = (value.indexOf('-') >= 0);

    // remove group symbols
    value = value.replaceAll(groupPart, '');

    // remove spaces, this helps with some locales that have spaces between a minus symbol 
    // and the number, or different types of space characters
    value = value.replace(/\s/g, '');

    // remove minus symbols. some locales have minus symbols after the number
    value = value.replace(/^-/, '').replace(/-$/, '');

    // replace decimal symbol with "."
    value = value.replace(decimalPart, '.');

    if (isNegative) {
        value = '-' + value;
    }

    // convert to number type
    value = Number(value);
}

parseInput('1.234,56'); // 1234.56
```

## Localizing a number input in react

Now we can create a simple react component, which references the functions from above.
The value in the state is the value of type number.
Everytime the number input is changed, we will parse it, and set it on the state.
Which will re-format the number into the input.

```javascript
const valueFromServer = 1234.56;
export default function NumberInput() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(valueFromServer);
  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setValue(parseInput(e.target.value));
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={formatNumber(value)} onChange={handleChange}/>
      <div>Number value: {value}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Localizing a number input in angular

I published a NPM package for angular called *ngx-decimal*: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-decimal

It handles everything for you. Example usage is:

```javascript
<input type="text" ngxDecimal [(ngModel)]="numberValue">
```

## Things to note

1. This doesn't handle locales that use different number symbols (like Bengaliâ€“Assamese).
2. It is a bit too lenient in parsing. For example, it will allow all locales to use a minus sign after the number.

## Summary

This solution has worked well in multiple enterprise web applications. 
It could be improved, to handle every locale perfectly, but at the cost of higher complexity.
